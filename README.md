# Wolfram Is Similar Evaluation Function

This repository contains an implementation of a Wolfram evaluation function that checks if a numerical value is within a specified tolerance and if that tolerance should be applied as an absolute value. It can also handle validating the equality of non-numeric objects, such as Strings. 

## Development
![Create Release Request](issues/new?template=release-request.yml&labels=release,deployment&title=release%3A%20%3Cevaluation-function-name%3E%20%E2%86%92%20%3Cbranch%)


### Run the Script

You can choose between running the Wolfram evaluation function itself, or using Shimmy to run the function.

**Local**

Use the following command to run the evaluation function directly:

```bash
wolframscript -f evaluation_function.wl request.json response.json
```

This will run the evaluation function using the input data from `request.json` and write the output to `response.json`.
An example `request.json` is:

```
{
  "method": "eval",
  "params": {
    "answer":"Sin[p x + q]",
	"response":"Sin[a x + b]",
	"params":{
		"comparisonType":"structure",
		"named_variables":"{x}",
		"correct_response_feedback":"Your answer is correct!",
		"incorrect_response_feedback":"Your answer is incorrect!"
	}
  }
}
```

Which gives the response:

```
{
  "command": "eval",
  "result": {
    "is_correct": true,
    "feedback": "Your answer is correct!",
    "error": null
  }
}
```

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Wolfram Engine](https://www.wolfram.com/engine/)
- [Wolfram Engine License](#development-license)

### Repository Structure

```bash
.github/workflows/
    build.yml          # builds the public evaluation function image
    deploy.yml         # deploys the evaluation function to Lambda Feedback

evaluation_function.wl # evaluation function source code

config.json            # evaluation function deployment configuration file
```

### Development Workflow

In its most basic form, the development workflow consists of writing the evaluation function in the `evaluation_function.wl` file and testing it locally. As long as the evaluation function adheres to the Evaluation Function API, a development workflow which incorporates using Shimmy is not necessary.

Testing the evaluation function can be done by running the script using the Wolfram Engine / WolframScript like so:

```bash
wolframscript -f evaluation_function.wl request.json response.json
```

> [!NOTE]
> Put the input data in the `request.json` file, and the output will be written to the `response.json` file.

### Building the Docker Image

To build the Docker image, run the following command:

```bash
docker build -t wolfram-evaluation-function .
```

### Running the Docker Image
To run the Docker image, you will need to mount a mathpass licence or pass an entitlement ID. To get these see [Licencing](#Wolfram-Engine-License
).

To run using mathpass development licence (this assumes that the mathpass file is in your local working directory:
```bash
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd)/mathpass:/home/wolframengine/.WolframEngine/Licensing/mathpass wolfram-evaluation-function
```

To run using the entitlement key:
```bash
docker run -it --rm -env WOLFRAMSCRIPT_ENTITLEMENTID=[YOUR_ENTITLEMENT_ID] wolfram-evaluation-function
```

### Sending requests to the image 
We recommend sending requests to your image using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), an easy to use interface for sending API requests.

If you prefer to use `curl` here is an example request:
```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/wolframEvaluationFunction' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'command: eval' \
--data '{
	"answer":"Sin[p x + q]",
	"response":"Sin[a x + b]",
	"params":{
		"comparisonType":"structure",
		"named_variables":"{x}",
		"correct_response_feedback":"Your answer is correct!",
		"incorrect_response_feedback":"Your answer is incorrect!"
	}
}'
```


## Deployment

This section guides you through the deployment process of the evaluation function. If you want to deploy the evaluation function to Lambda Feedback, follow the steps in the [Lambda Feedback](#deploy-to-lambda-feedback) section. Otherwise, you can deploy the evaluation function to other platforms using the [Other Platforms](#deploy-to-other-platforms) section.

### Deploy to Lambda Feedback

Deploying the evaluation function to Lambda Feedback is simple and straightforward, as long as the repository is within the [Lambda Feedback organization](https://github.com/lambda-feedback).

After configuring the repository, a [GitHub Actions workflow](.github/workflows/deploy.yml) will automatically build and deploy the evaluation function to Lambda Feedback as soon as changes are pushed to the main branch of the repository.

**Configuration**

The deployment configuration is stored in the `config.json` file. Choose a unique name for the evaluation function and set the `EvaluationFunctionName` field in [`config.json`](config.json).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The evaluation function name must be unique within the Lambda Feedback organization, and must be in `lowerCamelCase`. You can find a example configuration below:

```json
{
  "EvaluationFunctionName": "compareStringsWithWolfram"
}
```

### Deploy to other Platforms

If you want to deploy the evaluation function to other platforms, you can use the Docker image to deploy the evaluation function.

Please refer to the deployment documentation of the platform you want to deploy the evaluation function to.

If you need help with the deployment, feel free to reach out to the Lambda Feedback team by creating an issue in the template repository.

## Wolfram Engine License

Wolfram Engine requires a valid license to run. For developing purposes, you can obtain a free Wolfram Engine license. This process is described in the following steps. If you want to read more about licensing, please refer to the [Wolfram Engine Licensing Documentation](https://hub.docker.com/r/wolframresearch/wolframengine).

### Production License

**1. Sign in to Wolfram Cloud**

Head over to the [Wolfram Cloud](https://www.wolframcloud.com/) and sign in or create a new Wolfram ID. If you don't have a Wolfram subscription, you can sign up for a free Wolfram Cloud Basic subscription.

**2. Create License Entitlement**

After signing in, open a Wolfram Cloud notebook and evaluate the [`CreateLicenceEntitlement`](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/CreateLicenseEntitlement.html) function.

```text
In[1]:= entitlement = CreateLicenseEntitlement[]

Out[1]= LicenseEntitlementObject[O-WSTD-DA42-GKX4Z6NR2DSZR, ...]
```

**3. Obtain the License Key**

Run the following command to obtain the entitlement ID:

```text
In[2]:= entitlement["EntitlementID"]

Out[2]= O-WSTD-DA42-GKX4Z6NR2DSZR
```

**4. Use the License Key**

Create an environment variable named `WOLFRAMSCRIPT_ENTITLEMENTID` with the entitlement ID:

```text
WOLFRAMSCRIPT_ENTITLEMENTID=O-WSTD-DA42-GKX4Z6NR2DSZR
```

This environment variable activates Wolfram Engine when running the `wolframscript` command.

### Development License

**1. Sign in or create a Wolfram ID.**

Head over to the [Wolfram Account Portal](https://account.wolfram.com/login/create) and sign in or create a new account.

**2. Get the Wolfram Engine license**

[Obtain the free license](https://www.wolfram.com/engine/free-license/) by following the instructions.

**3. Activate the Wolfram Engine license**

Run the following command and enter your Wolfram Account credentials to generate a password for the license:

```bash
docker run -it wolframresearch/wolframengine
```

While still in the container, run the following command to print the password:

```plain
In[1] := $PasswordFile // FilePrint
1e1d781ed0a3    6520-03713-97466        4304-2718-2K5ATR        5095-179-696:2,0,8,8:80001:20190627
```

This gives you a password that you can copy to a `mathpass` file on your host machine.

**4. Run the Wolfram Engine container**

Run the following command to start the Wolfram Engine container with the license:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd)/mathpass:/home/wolframengine/.WolframEngine/Licensing/mathpass wolframresearch/wolframengine
```

This command assumes that you have a `mathpass` file in the current directory, and the container is started with the `wolframengine` user.
